## Toasty CSS

### Background

Life is beautiful, websites should be too. Toasty CSS is a frontend library and grid system governed by a series of design and philosophical ideals to make creating responsive, beautiful websites easier than ever. Aside from just being great for layouts, Toasty CSS has a fully styled set of prebuilt components (buttons, form components, etc) that will give your websites a professional, contemporary, and most importantly, consistent look. The components are designed to be color-neutral, allowing you to change your color scheme as needed by setting just a few variables.

### Functionality & MVP  

With Toasty CSS, users will be able to:

- [ ] Quickly build responsive web layouts using the grid system
- [ ] Style their websites easily with prebuilt components
- [ ] Walk through the creation of a project using Toasty CSS in the demonstration page
- [ ] Easily see how Toasty CSS works through the myriad of demonstrations on the main page

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] An implementation of FontAwesome's icon package for visual components in the library

### Wireframes

This app will be mostly a static page built in order to show off various aspects of the Toasty CSS library, including the grid system, pre-built components, typographical and color choices, as well as modifications to the library.

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be based almost entirely around HTML and CSS, but jQuery may be used in some placed for demonstration of a component or to create clickable effects. The FontAwesome icon library will also be used to produce visual components like hamburger buttons, settings buttons, and the like.

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: This day is mostly for building the grid system and mastering CSS flexbox, which will be used as the backbone of the framework. In addition the demonstration page will begin being built.

**Day 2**:  I'm going to be primarily focused on building components and pre-built CSS elements, as well as integrating FontAwesome's icon library into the framework.

**Day 3**: Now that the basics are out of the way, Day 3 is mainly building the demonstration page in an appealing way and fine-tuning anything that needs it in the framework or the components.

**Day 4**: Day 4 is dedicated to polishing the demonstration page and making sure it is the best possible thing I can display to potential recruiters.


### Bonus features

There are a couple of different ways I could take this project, some options include:

- [ ] Adding jQuery elements to the library for advanced components and fancier animations
- [ ] Improving the browser support for older browsers that may not support flexbox or other CSS3 things being used
- [ ] Adding mobile-specific support for some of the features like the grid
